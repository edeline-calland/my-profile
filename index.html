				<h1>Hello, I'm Edeline 😎</h1>

				<p>
					I'm a <strong>business student</strong> 👩🏽‍💼, interesting in marketing, and especially <strong>digital marketing</strong> 💼. That's why I'm willing to learn more about <strong>coding and web development</strong> 👩🏽‍💻. I'm also a <strong>swimmer</strong> 🏊🏼‍ and did a bit of <strong>krav maga and boxing</strong> 🥊.

				<h2>👩🏽‍💼 Marketing 💼</h2>
				<p>
					As an ESSEC Business School's student, I discovered the various aspects of marketing and I would now love to become a <strong>product manager</strong>, but with a high emphasis on digital. Indeed, next year I'll be joining a master in <strong>digital strategies and data marketing</strong>.

				<h2>👩🏽‍💻 Web Development 💻</h2>
				<p>
					Always interested in coding and discovering the computer languages, I followed Le Wagon's <strong>UX/UI design</strong> class 2 years ago, and I figured the <strong>web development</strong> was the next step to take. I discovered some basis of it previously, but I'm really glad to be able to deepen my knowledge, which will be useful for my work, as I noticed during an internship. So far, I love it and I really have fun coding!

				<h2>🏊🏼‍ Swimming and fighting 🥊</h2>
				<p>
					Since as long as I can remember, I've been <strong>swimming</strong>. We could almost say that I've grown up into water. When I grew older, I decided to do some <strong>competition</strong>. However, it wasn't because I loved competing against others. I didn't care about it. The one weekly hour just wasn't enough so the only solution I had to swim more was to enroll for competition.<br>
					Later on, I also decided to do some <strong>krav maga</strong> and other fighting sports, because I wanted to be able to <strong>stand for myself</strong> and defend myself. It was very interesting, I learned a lot of things, and now, I'm able to kick someone properly!
